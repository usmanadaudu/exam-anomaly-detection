# 🕵️‍♂️ Examination Proctoring Aid System

A light-weight proctoring system based on computer vision to detect anomalies during examinations. The system uses facial landmark tracking (MediaPipe), head pose estimation (MediaPipe) and object detection (YOLO) to monitorstudent behaviour and flag anomalous activities like:

- Looking left or right
- Speaking
- Presence of mobile phones
